\section{Discussion}
A classification of audio samples was performed using two approaches. The results on the clustering show that the automatic cluster differ strongly from the human sorted classes. Nevertheless the classification of samples based directly on the human sorting showed quite good results. Consequently the task of assigning samples is possible and further research on this has the potential of much improvement.\\
One big area of open research are the features. More and/or better features could give a much better differentiation of the samples. Also a listening test for measuring the perceived distance in between samples could be done. This could then be used to check how good the perceived differences correlate with the distances the algorithm calculates.
