\section{Conclusion}
A classification of audio samples was performed using two approaches. The results of the $k$-Means clustering show that algorithmically calculated classes differ strongly from human classification. The $k$-NN classification of samples based directly on human perception showed very good results. Consequently, the task of assigning samples to a given musical track is possible and further research on this has the potential to strongly improve the classification.\\
One big area of open research are the features. More or better features should give a much better differentiation of the samples. In particular, the given features represent pitch only very crudely. Informal listening tests confirm that the algorithm tends to ignore pitch differences.\\
Also, a listening test for measuring the perceived distance between samples could be done. This could then be used to check how the perceived differences correlate with the DTW-distances the algorithm calculates.
