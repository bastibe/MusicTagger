\section{Measurements and Results}
\label{sec:Measurements}
A test sample base was created with ten tracks for each class. All of the test samples were new samples that were not included in the training sample base.

\subsection{$k$-Means}
The $k$-Means algorithm was used to calculate $k=10$ class centers in our sample base using a batch size of 500 points and 50 iterations. These classes were used to classify our test sample base. The tags of the test samples within each of the 10 class clusters created by the $k$-Means algorithm were counted. The results are shown in figure~\ref{fig:k-Means}.\\
It can be seen that the algorithmically calculated classes do not correspond to the tags defined by our sample base. This was to be expected. Nevertheless, it seems that there are some consistent mappings in the structuring of the tags. This needs to be verified with further research.

\subsection{$k$-Nearest-Neighbors}
All the samples in the test sample bank were classified using the implemented $k$-NN algorithm with $k=10$. The results are shown in figure~\ref{fig:k-NN}. The tags of the test bank are plotted against the tags of the classification. It can be seen that many of the samples are classified correctly. The results exceeded our expectations. The variations in the classification correlate with the variances between samples of the same tag in the sample base. This means that the classes that are badly classified are also hard to classify by human perception.
