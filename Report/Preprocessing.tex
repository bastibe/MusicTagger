\section{Preprocessing of the Samples}
\label{sec:Preprocessing}

In order to make samples more comparable, all samples are preprocessed before calculating any features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Multi-channel samples are panned to mono.
  \item Silence at the beginning and end of each sample is cut off.
  \item All samples are normalized to an RMS of 1.
\end{itemize}
