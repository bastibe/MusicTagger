\section{Preprocessing of the Samples}
\label{sec:Preprocessing}
In order to make samples more comparable, all samples are preprocessed. First, the multi-channel samples are panned to mono. Since there are no spatial features used in the project, no stereo information is needed. Second, silence at the beginning and end of each sample is cut off. All signal below a threshold level at -75~dBFS is detected as silence. Lastly, all samples were amplified to have an RMS of 1 in order to normalize the energy of the samples.
